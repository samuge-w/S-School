## üß† The Debugging Methodology

All three guides teach the same core methodology:

```
1. READ ‚Üí Understand the error message
2. IDENTIFY ‚Üí What's actually wrong?
3. VERIFY ‚Üí Check current state
4. FIX ‚Üí Apply appropriate solution
5. TEST ‚Üí Confirm it's fixed
6. LEARN ‚Üí Understand why it happened
```

### **Applied to "No Such Table" Errors:**

```
1. READ
   ‚Üì
   "SQLSTATE[HY000]: no such table: curricula"
   
2. IDENTIFY
   ‚Üì
   Table "curricula" doesn't exist or wrong name
   
3. VERIFY
   ‚Üì
   Commands: migrate:status, db:show
   
4. FIX
   ‚Üì
   Run: migrate, fix model, clear cache
   
5. TEST
   ‚Üì
   Refresh browser, verify working
   
6. LEARN
   ‚Üì
   Understand migration ‚Üí model ‚Üí table flow
```

---

## üìä What Error Was Fixed?

### **Original Error Screen:**
```
Internal Server Error

Illuminate\Database\QueryException

SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1 no such table: curricula
(Connection: sqlite, SQL: select * from "curricula" where "is_active" = 1)

GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/dashboard
PHP 8.4.14 ‚Äî Laravel 11.9.2
```

### **Root Causes Identified:**

1. **Missing Tables**
   - Migrations hadn't been run
   - Tables `curriculums` and `curriculum_subjects` didn't exist

2. **Table Name Mismatch**
   - Error looked for: `curricula`
   - Actual table name: `curriculums`
   - Model didn't specify table name

3. **No Data**
   - Tables needed to be populated
   - Seeder hadn't been run

4. **Cached Views**
   - Old cached data was being served
   - Caches needed clearing

### **Solutions Applied:**

```bash
# 1. Created tables
php artisan migrate

# 2. Fixed model
# Added: protected $table = 'curriculums';

# 3. Populated data
php artisan db:seed --class=BeiraUnidaSeeder

# 4. Cleared caches
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear

# 5. Refreshed browser
Ctrl + F5
```

### **Result:**
‚úÖ Dashboard loads perfectly  
‚úÖ All 3 curricula visible  
‚úÖ 38 subjects accessible  
‚úÖ No errors!

## üîç Key Insights Documented

### **Insight 1: Error Messages Are Specific**
Don't read "error" and panic. The message tells you exactly what's wrong:
- "no such table: X" = Table X missing or wrong name
- "no such column: Y" = Column Y missing
- "table X has no column Y" = Column missing from specific table

### **Insight 2: Laravel's Naming Conventions**
Model names don't always match table names:
- Model: `Curriculum` ‚Üí Laravel expects: `curricula`
- Migration created: `curriculums`
- Solution: Always set `protected $table`

### **Insight 3: Order Matters**
1. First: Run migrations (create structure)
2. Second: Fix models (configure access)
3. Third: Run seeders (add data)
4. Fourth: Clear caches (refresh state)
5. Last: Test (verify working)

### **Insight 4: Verification is Critical**
Don't assume anything works:
- Check migration status
- Verify tables exist
- Confirm data present
- Test model access

### **Insight 5: Cache is Real**
Laravel caches aggressively:
- Views are compiled
- Config is cached
- Routes are cached
- Always clear after changes
