## Problem Identified

You were absolutely right - the old dashboard at `/dashboard` was:
- ❌ Confusing and cluttered
- ❌ Generic (not tailored to Beira Unida)
- ❌ No Beira Unida branding
- ❌ Complex charts and graphs that weren't useful
- ❌ Didn't showcase the three-curriculum system
- ❌ License information hidden

## Solution: Brand New Beira Unida Dashboard

I've created a **completely new dashboard** specifically designed for Beira Unida!

### What's New ✨

#### 1. **Beautiful Beira Unida Header**
- School name in English and Portuguese
- School motto: "Formando corações e mentes" • "Shaping Hearts and Minds"
- Elegant gradient design
- Professional branding

#### 2. **License Status Front and Center**
- Shows if license is expiring soon (< 30 days)
- Shows if license is expired
- Color-coded warnings (yellow = expiring, red = expired, green = active)
- Direct link to license management

#### 3. **Clean Key Statistics**
- Active Students
- Teachers
- Classes
- **Curricula** (shows "3")
- Beautiful card design with icons
- Hover effects

#### 4. **Quick Action Buttons**
Four prominent buttons for common tasks:
- **New Student Admission** - Direct link to admit students
- **View Curricula** - Browse all three curricula
- **Student List** - View all students
- **License Settings** - Manage license

#### 5. **Curriculum Overview Panel**
- Lists all 3 curricula (Ambleside, Cambridge, Nacional)
- Shows subject count for each
- Shows how many students are in each curriculum
- Direct "View" button for each curriculum

#### 6. **Today's Highlights**
- Today's attendance (Present/Absent/Late)
- Current session
- Total subjects
- Today's date

#### 7. **Clean, Modern Design**
- Card-based layout
- Soft shadows and hover effects
- Color-coded sections
- Responsive (works on tablets/phones)
- No clutter or confusing charts

## What Was Removed

❌ Complicated income/expense graphs
❌ Complex attendance charts by section
❌ Confusing fee payment tables
❌ Generic statistics that weren't helpful
❌ Calendar widget (can add back if needed)
