## 🎯 What Was Wrong

**Error Message:**
```
SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1 no such table: curricula
```

**Root Cause:**
1. Migrations hadn't been run yet
2. Curricula and subjects tables didn't exist
3. Model was looking for wrong table name

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### **1. Ran Migrations**
```bash
php artisan migrate
```
- Created `curriculums` table
- Created `curriculum_subjects` table
- Added `curriculum_id` to `Student` table

### **2. Fixed Model Table Name**
Updated `app/Models/Curriculum.php`:
```php
protected $table = 'curriculums';
```
Laravel was looking for "curricula" but the table is named "curriculums".

### **3. Ran Seeder**
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=BeiraUnidaSeeder
```
**Successfully seeded:**
- ✅ 3 Curricula (Ambleside, Cambridge, Nacional)
- ✅ 38 Subjects (all preloaded for each curriculum)
- ✅ Beira Unida institute information

### **4. Cleared All Caches**
```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
```
