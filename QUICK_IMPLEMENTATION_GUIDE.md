# Beira Unida Front-End - Quick Implementation Guide

## 🎯 What Was The Problem?

You customized the Beira Unida system with:
- ✅ Three curricula (Ambleside, Cambridge, Nacional)
- ✅ 38 subjects across all curricula
- ✅ License management system
- ✅ Bilingual interface

**BUT:** None of these features were visible or accessible in the front-end!

---

## ✨ What I Fixed

### 1. **Curriculum Management** (NOW VISIBLE ✅)

**What:** Created beautiful interface to view all curricula and their subjects

**Access:** `Academics` → `Curriculum` (sidebar menu)

**Features:**
- View all 3 curricula
- See subject counts
- Click to view detailed subjects by grade
- Professional design with cards and icons

---

### 2. **Curriculum Selection in Admissions** (NOW WORKING ✅)

**What:** Added curriculum dropdown to student admission and edit forms

**Where:** 
- `Student Information` → `Student Admission`
- Student edit page

**Impact:**
- Staff can now properly select which curriculum student follows
- Required field with validation
- Shows helpful descriptions

---

### 3. **Updated Navigation** (NOW ORGANIZED ✅)

**What:** Added missing menu items to sidebar

**Added:**
- "Curriculum" under Academics section
- "License Settings" under Settings section

**Impact:**
- All Beira Unida features now accessible from menu
- No more hidden features

---

## 📋 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
cd /path/to/beira-unida
php artisan migrate
```

This adds the `curriculum_id` column to the Student table.

---

### Step 2: Verify Curricula Are Seeded

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=BeiraUnidaSeeder
```

(If already seeded, you'll see "already exists" messages - that's fine!)

---

### Step 3: Clear Caches

```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

---

### Step 4: Test The Changes

1. **Login to the system**
2. **Click "Academics" → "Curriculum"** from sidebar
   - Should see all 3 curricula
   - Click "View Subjects" on any curriculum
   - Should see subjects organized by grade

3. **Click "Student Information" → "Student Admission"**
   - Should see "Curriculum" dropdown (NEW!)
   - Should see "Class / Grade" dropdown
   - Try creating a test student

4. **Click "Settings" → "License Settings"**
   - Should access license page
   - Previously hidden, now visible!

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to add secretary role with simplified interface:

1. Create secretary permissions
2. Build secretary-specific dashboard
3. Create wizard-style admission form

**But:** The current implementation is fully functional and ready for production use!

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Problem:** "Curriculum" menu item doesn't appear
- **Solution:** Clear browser cache (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`)

**Problem:** Curriculum dropdown empty in admission form
- **Solution:** Run `php artisan db:seed --class=BeiraUnidaSeeder`

**Problem:** Migration error
- **Solution:** Check if `curriculum_id` column already exists: `php artisan migrate:status`

**Problem:** "Class 'App\Models\Curriculum' not found"
- **Solution:** Run `composer dump-autoload`
